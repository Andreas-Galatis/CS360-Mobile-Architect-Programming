# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?  #

As part of Mobile2Appâ€™s initiative to Develop and launch a fully functional mobile application, the team launched a weight tracking app. The weight tracking app will be an invaluable tool in setting goals, logging weight progress, and monitoring trends for users. 

** What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful? **

The app uses data visualization techniques for quick and efficient analysis, and incorporates reminders and notifications to keep users informed, engaged, and up to date on their progress. Users are able to make accurate valuations on their weight management approach by having all the data they need arranged consistently on one app.


How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
Coding was done in iterations and milestones. For example, one week research was conducted to determine user goals and a target audience, then another week we worked on applying Android guidelines for typography, colors, and layout. We then completed milestones by designing the UI followed by coding the design element and the app features such as authentication, displaying data, and implementing notifications

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
Testing was done throughout each iteration as feedback was collected, and manual testing was done to ensure that each feature was working as expected. Several test-cases were used, such as various inputs a user might enter, and ensuring that the screen navigations was working correctly without making the app crash.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

The innovations came in the design of the app, as we included icons, and incorporated primary and secondary colors to give the app branding and make it look professional, as well as aesthetically pleasing elements to enhance the UI.

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

The layout of the app was done well by incorporating a table and buttons for the user to interact with the app in a seamless way. The code also used several classes and functions to
